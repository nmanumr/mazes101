# Prim

[:octicons-file-code-24: Source](https://github.com/nmanumr/mazes101/blob/master/src/generators/prim.ts)

{{ maze('rectangular', (10, 10), 'prim') }}

Initializes a set with an arbitrary cell. Randomly chooses a cell from the set. If it has no unvisited neighbors,
removes it from the set. Otherwise, chooses one of the cellâ€™s unvisited neighbors, links the two together,
and adds the neighbor to the set. Repeats until the set is not empty.

### Typical features

A strong radial texture centered on the starting cell. Mazes tend to have more dead ends than other algorithms,
and shorter paths.

## Usage

```js
import {generate} from 'mazes101/generators/prim';

board = generate(board, {getNextRowNeighbours, removeInterWall});
```

### Required Functions

**`#!ts getNeighbours(index: number, board: Board): number[]`**
:   Get indexes of cells neighbour to the given `index`. This shouldn't include disabled cells. 

**`#!ts removeInterWall(index1: number, index2: number, board: Board): Board`**
:   Remove wall between given two cells `index1` and `index2`.
  The function should return a board with walls between both cells removed.
