## Anatomy

### Size Parameters

A rectangular board has two size parameters:

1. `radius`: 
2. `innerRadius`

### Position

Position of each cell is represented by polar coordinates where:

* `r` is rth row from center, starts from first visible row
* `t` is nth cell in rth row

### Directions

Each cell in a rectangular board utilizes 4 directions as following:

1. Top clockwise (mask: `0b00001` or `1`)
2. Top counter-clockwise (mask: `0b00010` or `2`)
3. Right (mask: `0b00100` or `4`)
4. Bottom (mask: `0b01000` or `8`)
5. Left (mask: `0b10000` or `16`)

If there is only one top cell it will be considered in top clockwise direction.
